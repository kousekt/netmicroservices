# K8 Orchestrations for the ASP .NET Core Microservices Course
These are kubernetes orchestration files for the awesome course (highly recommended) that I bought here that teaches you how to write production grade microservices.

This course is highly recommended.  Keep an eye out for future releases/upgrades to this course that will 
include new technologies including the possibility of orchestrations.
